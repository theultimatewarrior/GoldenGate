		<p>The Golden Gate Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the Golden Gate, the opening of the San Francisco Bay into the Pacific Ocean. As part of both U.S. Route 101 and California State Route 1, the structure links the city of San Francisco, on the northern tip of the San Francisco Peninsula, to Marin County. It is one of the most internationally recognized symbols of San Francisco, California, and the United States. It has been declared one of the modern Wonders of the World by the American Society of Civil Engineers. The Frommers travel guide considers the Golden Gate Bridge "possibly the most beautiful, certainly the most photographed, bridge in the world".</p>

		<h1>History</h1>
		<p>Before the bridge was built, the only practical short route between San Francisco and what is now Marin County was by boat across a section of San Francisco Bay. Ferry service began as early as 1820, with regularly scheduled service beginning in the 1840s for purposes of transporting water to San Francisco. The Sausalito Land and Ferry Company service, launched in 1867, eventually became the Golden Gate Ferry Company, a Southern Pacific Railroad subsidiary, the largest ferry operation in the world by the late 1920s. Once for railroad passengers and customers only, Southern Pacific's automobile ferries became very profitable and important to the regional economy. The ferry crossing between the Hyde Street Pier in San Francisco and Sausalito in Marin County took approximately 20 minutes and cost US$1.00 per vehicle, a price later reduced to compete with the new bridge. The trip from the San Francisco Ferry Building took 27 minutes.</p>

		</div>
		<p>Many wanted to build a bridge to connect San Francisco to Marin County. San Francisco was the largest American city still served primarily by ferry boats. Because it did not have a permanent link with communities around the bay, the city's growth rate was below the national average. Many experts said that a bridge couldn’t be built across the 6,700 ft (2,042 m) strait. It had strong, swirling tides and currents, with water 372 ft (113 m) deep at the center of the channel, and frequent strong winds. Experts said that ferocious winds and blinding fogs would prevent construction and operation.</p>

		<p class="full">More than four decades after Crocker's call for a bridge, James H. Wilkins, a structural engineer and a newspaper editor for the San Francisco Call Bulletin, proposes the first serious design for spanning the Golden Gate. He campaigns for a bridge, catching the attention of San Francisco City Engineer Michael M. O'Shaughnessy. O'Shaughnessy consults engineers about feasibility and cost. The majority speculate that a bridge will cost over $100 million -- yet Joseph Strauss, who has designed nearly 400 spans, claims it can be built for only $25 to $30 million.</p>

		<hr class="faded" />
		<span class="date">1921</span><br />
		<p class="full">O'Shaughnessy considers the engineers' proposals. Lindenthal has estimated a minimum cost of $56 million -- disqualifying himself. McMath never officially responds. Joseph Strauss, unaware that two other engineers have been contacted as well, submits preliminary sketches to O'Shaugnessy with a cost estimate of $27 million.</p>

They believe a special district is necessary to manage financing, design and construction of the bridge, and in order for all counties that may be affected to have a voice in the proceedings.</p>
		<p class="full">Strauss adds Charles Ellis, professor of structural and bridge engineering at the University of Illinois, to his staff. Ellis's job is to draw up the new plans.</p>

Working twelve to fourteen hours a day, and consulting via telegram with Moisseiff in New York, Ellis personally computes dozens of factors, and completes the overall design in four months. At a meeting in June, Ellis' design will be reviewed by the three consultants.</p>
		<p class="full">Strauss hires a local architect, Irving Morrow, to design an architectural treatment for the bridge. Morrow will later be recognized for his aesthetic contributions: the Golden Gate Bridge's distinctive Art Deco lines, burnt red-orange hue, and the structure's dramatic lighting.</p>

The vote is 145,657 in favor and 46,954 against.<br />Strauss directs Ellis to begin the thousands of detail calculations involving suspension ropes, decks, floor beams, highway track, cables, towers, and more. Ellis writes the specifications for all ten bridge construction contracts, covering everything from cable wire to suspender ropes to concrete for the anchorages.</p>
